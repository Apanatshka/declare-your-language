=============

These are lecture notes that go with the Compiler Construction course taught at Delft University of Technology.

The course takes the perspective of *declarative language definition*, using high-level declarative meta-language the define / specify the various aspects of programming languages. Given such definitions, the implementation of various compiler components can be generated automatically. In the course we study the use of meta-languages to define compilers. In the `lab assignments <https://tudelft-in4303-2017.github.io/assignments/>`_ for the course students build a compiler for MiniJava, a subset of the Java programming language using the `Spoofax Language Workbench <http://www.metaborg.org>`_.

In the lectures and in these lecture notes, we study these meta-languages, and also their underlying theory and implementation.


.. goal: enable you to design and implement languages

.. learn the concepts

.. not explore all possible implementation / algorithms / approaches

.. should be sufficient to study other approaches on your own
